C-Tools

Cool macros and utilities for C.  
Inspired by ANSI C Color macros written by Jeremy Wright (https://bitbucket.org/jwright).

This repo will probably contain a random assortment of cool tricks in C, but for now it's 
just some silly color macros that, for some reason, I find fascinating.  Color all the text!!
